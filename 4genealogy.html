					<p>Fire Emblem 4 stands out from the rest of the series. The game has close connections to the previous games. Fire Emblem 1 to 3 all take place in the same world around the same time with characters from each one showing up between games and events being mentioned. Fire Emblem 4 is set hundreds of years before Fire Emblem 1. This was in part to the fact that the initial idea for the game was so different that it wasn't originally called Fire Emblem. It was dubbed Holy Sword Emblem Kaiser. The name ended up being too long and development eventually brought the game much closer to being a Fire Emblem game. The game draws a lot more from Norse and Celtic mythology than the classic mythology the rest of the series is based on. The storyline for the game focused more on realism with elements such as particide and incest being key points in the story. The game featured two acts one that served as an introduction setting up the second act. A third act was originally planned to take place between the first and second acts. It ended up being cut due to time constraints. The game underwent so many changes during development that one member of staff guessed that the game may have been remade two or three times during development.</p>

Faces looked similar so hairstyle was the main way a unit portrait could be indentified. Battles had been given backgrounds to take place in. It was possible to see different types of weapons in battle.</p>

					<article id="map1" class="left"><img src="fe4/map.jpg" width="400" height="200"><p>Genealogy maps tended to be quite large. The game has a lot less chapters than most other games due to map size. This tends to work both for and against the game. On one hand it feels like you are actually taking down a country, but moving your army across terrain can get a bit tedious since each unit needs to be individually moved. </p>

						<p id="peep">Fire Emblem 4 released in the year 1996. That was a very strong year for video games a number of notable releases overshadowing the game such as Super Mario 64, PokeMon Red and Blue, Resident Evil, and Quake. The game wasn't breaking any records for graphics but it was far from the worst offering available at the time when people were grappling with 3D development on the newer consoles.</p>

					<h2>Plot of the game</h2>
					<p> In the year Grann 757, barbarians from the kingdom of Issach siege Darna Castle, and Prince Kurth of Grannvale and his friend Lord Byron of Chalpy set out on a punitive expedition. When the southwestern kingdom of Verdane takes advantage of Grannvale's weakened state to invade, Byron's son Sigurd repels them and launches a counter-invasion. During the campaign, Sigurd meets a mysterious girl named Deirdre. She is revealed to be of Naga blood, a long-lost member of the Grannvalian royal family, and the descendant of the crusader with the power to defeat the evil dragon Loptyr. Sigurd and Deirdre fall in love and marry, and their son Seliph is born in Agustria. At this point, an alliance of Grannvale dukes stage an attempt to seize the throne, murder Kurth, and frame Sigurd and his father for the crime. Sigurd is forced into exile, while the archbishop Manfroy of the Loptyr Sect kidnaps Deirdre and erases her memories in order to use her to resurrect Loptyr. His plan is to wed her to Lord Arvis of Velthomer - the two are, unbeknownst to them, half siblings, and their union will produce a human vessel capable of hosting the consciousness of Loptyr. During their exile, Sigurd and his allies are forced to hide Seliph and the rest of their children from the forces of Arvis and the Loptyr cult. After a year in exile, Sigurd begins making his way back through Jugdral, killing the Dukes responsible for the false accusation. Apparently exonerated, Sigurd returns to Grannvale, only to learn that Arvis has married Deirdre to become Grannvale's king. Arvis orders Sigurd's allies to be executed and personally murders Sigurd in a playable sequence.</p> 

					 <p>Over the next fifteen years, Grannvale expands to hold dominion over the whole of Judgral, and Arvis turns Grannvale into an empire and styles himself emperor. He and Deirdre have twin children: Julius, the scion of Loptyr, and Julia, the scion of Naga. Manfroy uses the Loptyr tome to corrupt Julius and turn him into Loptyr's vessel, and Deirdre sacrifices herself to warp Julia away from Julius. Julius overthrows his father and turns the Empire into a tyrannical regime. At this point, Seliph comes out of hiding to protect a nearby village, revealing his long-hidden existence to Grannvale. Traveling across the lands of Jugdral, Seliph reunites with the long-hidden children of Sigurd's companions, including Julia. Making his way through the countries of Jugdral, he gains support from the surviving powers, and gradually frees Grannvale's conquered territories. Arvis is powerless to subvert his son's rule, and is killed in battle against Seliph. During the course of these battles, Julia is captured and Manfroy and Julius attempt to sacrifice her as her powers could banish Loptyr for good. Seliph manages to save her, and after defeating Manfroy and Julius in battle, Julia successfully banishes Loptyr, ending his rule for good and allowing Jugdral to recover from the recent conflicts. Seliph takes his rightful place on the throne as the emperor of Grannvale, and restores power to the surrounding countries with their respective heirs.</p>

					<h2>The Game's Reception</h2>
					<article>
						<p>		Fire Emblem 4 was pretty popular when it released by 2002 it was the second best selling game in the franchise behind Fire Emblem 3 by a significant margin. The game received a score of 31 out of 40 from Japanese gaming magizine Famitsu. The streamlining of the game and adoption of new mechanics made the game a bit easier to learn. The story was much darker than previous Fire Emblems and often touted as one of its strongest features. </p>

							<h2>Establishing a Franchise</h2>
						<p>
						Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War is an incredibly important game in the series. It established many things that have come to be staples of the series and represents a very ambitious attempt at combining story and gameplay for the time. 
						</p>
						<ul id="circle">
						<li>The Weapon Triangle: This is the Fire Emblem game that added the weapon triangle to the series. The triangle is between lances, axes, and swords. Swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. This means that relying on a single unit is often risky if a map is filled with units they are weak to.</li><br>

						<li>Support System: The support system depending on who you talk to is either one of the best features or the worst. Basically by fighting together on the same map units will eventually fall in love and get married. This can be sped up by placing units next to each other though units gain affinity with everyone of the opposite gender each turn. </li><br>

						<li>A Second Generation: Fire Emblem 4 has a time skip of 15 years. During this time your units that survived and married will have children. Those children will become your new playable units. There are a number of potential parents that each child can have. Pairing up units in certain ways can influence stat growths and give the children access to minor and major holy blood. Holy blood gives you better stat growths and gives you access to very powerful legendary weapons. The most extreme example of this is Forseti granting +20 in one stat turning a unit into an unkillable murder machine. If a child's parent died or was not married before the time skip then they are replaced by a substitute character. These characters have fixed skills, equipment, and growth rates. They generally just replace them in the story often having similar dialogue and events to their counterparts.</li><br>
						<li>Home Base: Before and during missions units may settle into a home base where they can do things such as repair weapons, buy, and sell items. Arena battles can also be run for additional gold. During missions players can visit castle towns to do such things as well. </li><br>
						</ul>
