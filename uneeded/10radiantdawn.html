					<h2>Plot of the game</h2>
					<p> Three years after the Mad King's War, detailed in Fire Emblem 9, Daein, the war's instigator and eventual loser, and the victorious nation Crimea are still in the process of rebuilding. Although Crimea is ruled by Queen Elincia, Daein lacks a proper successor and is instead ruled by the occupation forces of the Begnion Empire. The Daein people are oppressed by the corrupt Begnion senate and imperial soldiers. A group of Daein rebels named the Dawn Brigade, headed by Micaiah and Sothe, act as vigilantes to provide some measure of hope against the oppressors. After being driven from the capital, the Dawn Brigade flees into the northern desert. There they encounter the heron prince Rafiel and the wolf laguz queen Nailah, whose people have not been seen in Tellius for millennia.</p> 

					<p>Soon after, the Dawn Brigade locates and allies with the late King Ashnard's orphan son Pelleas, his scheming and ruthless adviser Izuka, and the former general of Daein known as the Black Knight. The group launches a guerrilla war against the occupation army, liberating former soldiers of Daein from prison camps and gaining the loyalty of the people. Micaiah's efforts become legendary during these campaigns, with the people of Daein dubbing her the "Silver-Haired Maiden." Word of the plight of the Daein people eventually reaches Empress Sanaki of Begnion, who sends her trusted advisor Sephiran to Daein to reign in the occupation army. The senate disavows and scapegoats occupation leader General Jarod, who is overthrown and killed by the liberation army in an assault on the capital. Unbeknownst to them all, Izuka tricks Pelleas into signing a contract known as a blood pact with the head of the Begnion senate, Lekain, which will kill increasingly large numbers of Daein citizens when triggered.</p> 

					 <p>The following chapters revolve around the Lycian lords Eliwood, Hector and their party, which the tactician, (and eventually Lyn) joins. The group are hunting down an antagonistic faction known as the Black Fang, a group of assassins based in Bern. The Black Fang, manipulated by a mysterious figure named Nergal, are attempting to provoke a full-scale war in Elibe, providing Nergal with an enormous amount of "quintessence", or life-force from fallen warriors. Nergal creates his morphs, artificial beings with jet-black hair and golden eyes, to remotely control the Black Fang, and to obtain the quintessence for him. The Black Fang engage Eliwood's interest by capturing his father Lord Elbert, and by inciting rebellion in Lycia. The protagonists' ultimate goal is to prevent Nergal from using their companions Ninian's and Nils' quintessence to open the Dragons' Gate, a portal where dragons reside, and thus ignite Elibe in conflict. As Eliwood and the party hunt the Black Fang down, they eliminate crucial figures of the Black Fang, as well as gaining allies and protecting Bern's royal prince Zephiel (a younger version of the main antagonist from The Binding Blade). The game ends when Eliwood and the party slay Nergal and the dragon that had been summoned via Nergal's quintessence. Eliwood becomes marquess of Pherae, and Hector inherits his brother's title as marquess of Ostia. A secret ending shows an older Eliwood and Hector introducing their respective children Roy and Lilina to each other, while a grown-up Zephiel, now the king of Bern, is being confronted by a robed man who accuses him of awakening the Demon Dragon.

					<h2>The Game's Reception</h2>
					<article>
						<p>		Fire Emblem 7 was fairly popular on its release. On aggregate site Metacritic, Fire Emblem garnered a score of 88/100 based on 31 reviews. It was the 6th best-reviewed GBA title of 2003. The tutorial was a bit of double edged sword. For new players it helped ease people into the game while to veterans and people that wanted to learn as they played it was intrusive. The game ended up selling around 272,000 units Japan alone.  </p>

							<h2>Establishing a Franchise</h2>
						<p>
						Fire Emblem: As the first Fire Emblem to be localized Fire Emblem 7 is a very important point in the series history and was many fans first entry into the series.
						</p>
						<ul id="circle">
						<li>The Player Avatar: Players create a unit referred to as the Tactician in many cases. The default name the game sets is named Mark, however the Tactician's name, gender, and birth month (or blood type in the Japanese version) are chosen by the player at the start of the game. The game features a ranking system depending on how you did mentions that historians are confused as how your army ever reached victory in the first place at the lowest ranking to starting a war to try and obtain you as a tactician at the highest ranking.</li><br>
						<li>Support System: The support system works differently in Fire Emblem 7 instead of deploying units on the same map having certain units stand next to each other for a certain amount of turns. There are only a limited amount of characters that can support each other. Reaching certain thresholds raises the support level to C, then B, and finally A.  Each character is only allowed a total of 5 support conversations so reaching A rank with two people is impossible. Depending on how you did supports endings will change. </li><br>
						<li>Three Protagonists:  The game features three different paths for each of its protagonists Lyn, Hector, and Eliwood. On the first playthrough of the game players will go through both Lyn's and Eliwood's routes back to back. Upon beating the game they can start with any path including Hector.</li><br>
						<li>Hard Mode:  The game features a harder version of the three paths the game offers that unlocks upon clearing certain conditions. The game unlocks Lyn and Eliwoods hard mode upon clearing the game. Hector's mode is unlocked on the first clear and Hector hard mode is unlocked upon clearing that. </li><br>
