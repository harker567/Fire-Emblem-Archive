					<p>Fire Emblem 1 was pretty ground breaking back when it first released. The game couldn't run normally on a Nintendo Entertainment System(NES) console. To get around the limitations of the console Intelligent Systems(IS) used a portion of memory dedicated to saving games to get around that. IS also created a chip for Fire Emblem that could process and display Japanese text with Nintendos help. Being experimental didn't always help though as the game was forced to downgrade its graphics to run as the memory chip they adopted didn't allow for some of the more elaborate cutscenes and graphics they had planned. The poor graphics were a major regret of the team at the time. </p>

					<article id="attackanimation" class="right"><img src="fe1/fe1 attack.gif"><p>Animation of the games combat. A lot of information is thrown at the player during an attack to prevent it from feeling overwhelming graphics were used to see how the battle could go. The Hit bar shows how likely that unit was to strike the opposing unit. </p>

					<h2>Plot of the game</h2>
					<p> Long ago, the continent Archanea takes place on was invaded by the Dolhr Empire, lead by the Shadow Dragon Medeus. Anri, a youth from the nation of Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using a divine sword named Falchion. The defeat of the shadow dragon lead to the Kingdom of Archanea being restored and the world entered an era of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by an evil wizard named Garnef, who has conquered Khadein a nation run by mages. Medeus and Gharnef form an alliance with the kingdom of Macedon and Grust with the intent to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice in the care of a fort manned by Altea's ally Gra. Gra betrays Cornelius to ally with the new Dolhr empire. This leads to Cornelius's death, Falchion's theft, and Elice sacrifing herself to ensure Marth's escape. Accompanied by a handful of knights, Marth takes refuge at the island nation of Talys. </p> 

					 <p>Several years later, after repelling a pirate invasion the king of Talys concludes that Marth is ready to battle Dolhr and retake his homeland. The king of Talys sends Marth out with several of his most trusted men alongside his daughter Princess Caeda. Marth's first course of action is to rescue the kingdom of Aurelis and enlists the aid of the king's younger brother, Duke Hardin and his retainers. He then meets with Princess Nyna, the last survivor of the Archanean royal family and leader of the resistance against Dohlr. Nyna gives Marth the Fire Emblem, a legendary treasure given to the hero destined to save the world. Marth and Nyna then march to Archanea and free it from Grust's grasp. After briefly invading Khadein to search for the legendary sword Falchion, Marth moves to retake his homeland Altea. After a successful battle to retake his homeland, Marth learns that his mother was killed in the invasion and Dolhr is holding his sister Elice prisoner. Marth then goes to the nation of Grust and battles their top general Camus.</p>

				 	<p>		Marth is then contacted by Gotoh, a wise old sage, who informs him that theGharnef wields Imhullu, a dark tome that makes him invincible; the only thing capable of defeating him is the magic of Starlight. Gotoh sends Marth to the Fane of Raman to find the materials needed to create Starlight; Marth also rescues the divine dragon, Tiki during this time. Marth then invades Macedon and deposes the tyrannical King Michalis with the aid of Michalis' sister Minerva. There, Gotoh reforges Starlight. Marth invades Khadein, defeats Gharnef, reclaims Falchion, and rescues his sister Elice. He then makes his way to Dohlr, battles, and defeats the dark dragon Medeus, returning peace to the land.</p>

					<h2>The Game's Reception</h2>
					<article>
						<p>		Critics were pretty harsh with the game complaining that the story was too confusing and that the graphics were poor. The game was a lot more popular with the general audience. The game recieved a score of 23 out of 30 in a poll in Family Computer Magazine. Sales began to pick up and by 2002 the game had become the third best selling game in the franchise out of the six games out at the time.  Many of the early Fire Emblems never got ported to the United States but people would create fan translations and share them online. </p>
							<h2>Establishing a Franchise</h2>
						<p>
						The first thing in a game series tend to establish the basic mechanics of future games, but Fire Emblem is a little special due to how much it reuses between games. Character concepts are often reused between games in ways fans have dubbed archetypes. The archetypes can range from having similar stats to a character or design cues. For example, an iconic archetype is the Cain and Abel archetype. Both of these units typically recruit very early and come on horses. Cain's typically has red armor, a focus on the stat strength strength, and a serious personality. Abels normally wear green, have a focus on the stat skill ,and are more laidback. 
						Outside of recurring archetypes and story beats Fire Emblem 1 established a lot of mechanics that have stood the test of time.</p>
						<ul id="circle">
						<li>Experience points: Units that fight in battle, heal, and kill enemies get experience points. Using experience points for a tactical game was rare at the time. Levels, stat growths, and starting states formed the metagame of Fire Emblem where certain units were found to be much stronger with work or required less work than others. For example, Jagen a starting unit is much stronger than the rest of your army for awhile. He scales very poorly however, meaning you shouldn't rely on him to avoid the time when he stops being useful.</li><br>
						<li>Stats: These were what created differences between your units. A unit generally has two important things relating to stats that set them apart from others. This is bases which is what the unit is recruited at. This means how strong they are the moment you get them. The other is stat growths. Leveling up in Fire Emblem has random stat growths. A unit growth is how likely that stat is to improve upon a level up.</li><br>
						<li>Weapon Durability: This mechanic introduced a limited number of uses to weapons including legendary weapons that had power beyond other weapons. It provided another dimension of tactics of when to use powerful weapons to get through tough areas.</li><br>
						<li>Permadeath: A unit that drops to zero hit points in the game dies and is never usable again. Marth must make it to the end of the game so anytime Marth dies the game immediately game overs and you have to redo the chapter. The mechanic makes it a lot more tense and stresses having a varied army so that specific counters don't rip through your army and helps drive home that units are unique.</li><br>
						<li>Character Epilogues: At the end of the game you would get a little bit of story about what the surviving characters did after the game ended. This ranged from Marth marrying Caeda if both survived to minor endings such as returning to their kingdom to care for orphans. This mechanic helps you care a bit more about making units survive the game and encourages a replay to see the epilogues you missed.</li><br>
	
						<li>Money: Money is typically rather scarce in Fire Emblem since, battles rarely drop money. The only sources of money are from certain scripted events, selling items, or wagering on arena battles. Arena is the only repeatable source of money wagering a set amount of money and a units life that they can win the arena battle to receive money. Money can be spent at secret shops to buy weapons and healing items. The metagame created by limited use weapons means that you need to obtain new weapons at a fairly brisk pace. Shops are one of the main ways you outfit your army.</li><br>
						<li>Character classes: A character's class determines what weapons they have access to. For example, a cavalier can use swords or lances. Base classes would occasionally have promoted classes that could be accessed after reaching a certain level and using a class specific item. A promotion would give a unit an immediate boost in stats and reset their level to 1 allowing another 20 levels of stats.</li>
