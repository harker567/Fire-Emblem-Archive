					<h2>Plot of the game</h2>
					<p> The game opens with Greil recruiting Ike into his band of mercenaries. While on a mission near the Crimean border, Ike rescues a woman from a Daein patrol who is revealed to be Elincia Ridell Crimea, a princess who narrowly escaped being killed with her family during the Daein invasion of Crimea. Daein attacks the mercenaries shortly after this, and they are forced to flee over the border into Gallia, a Laguz nation. They are pursued by the Black Knight, who kills Greil in single combat before being driven off by the Gallians. Ike and Elincia decide to work together to drive the forces of Daein from Crimea. </p>

					<p>Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions overcome long-held racial tensions between the Beorc and Laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, Ashnard, king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to re-establish relations between the Beorc empire of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron Laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of genocide known as the Serenes Massacre. During the course of their journey, they discover that Ashnard is provoking the war to try and release the dark deity contained inside the Medallion, using Daein's invasion as a template for his plan. In the final assault, Ike and his mercenaries manage to defeat both the Black Knight and Ashnard, thwarting the scheme. With Ashnard defeated and the Daein occupation ended, Elincia is crowned as Crimea's new queen, who works to make the land a place where Beorc and Laguz can live in peace.</p>

					<h2>The Game's Reception</h2>
					<article>
						<p>		The game sold very well right from its release moving 100k units in its first week. Nintendo considered it among their most successful GameCube titles for 2005. The game features some heavy themes of racism, how people divide themselves, and the meaning of strength. </p>
							<h2>Establishing a Franchise</h2>
						<p>
						Fire Emblem 9 was the series first attempt at 3D and is one of the few games completely unconnected to the world of Archanea and Marth. It used a number of new mechanics.</p>
						<ul id="circle">
						<li>New Races: Fire Emblem 9 features a new race called the Laguz. They fill a bar each turn that when full transforms them into a powerful fighter.</li><br>

						<li>Unit Classes: Units will auto promote upon reaching level 20. In previous games you were forced to use master seals to promote units. You can still use master seals to promote early in Fire Emblem 9.</li><br>

						<li>Battle Preparation: Before a battle Soren tactician in your army will provide info on how the last battle went. You can engage in support conversations and info conversations that are rated on a scale of one to three stars. One star conversations give story background. Two stars mark hints on beating the map. Three stars indicate that the conversation might result in a reward such as a special ability, item, or new playable character. </li><br>
